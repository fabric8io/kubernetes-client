/**
 * Interface that describes the operation that can be done on a Kubernetes resource (e.g. Pod, Service etc).
 * This is intended to act as the common denominator of resource operations. To accomodate resources with more specialized operations, this interface should be used as a base.
 * @param <I>   The input for the operations (usually corresponds to the resource type).
 * @param <T>   The output of the operations (usually corresponds to the resource type). In most cases its the same as the input.
 * @param <D>   The "Inlineable / Doneable" type of the resource.
 * @param <B>   The return type for {@link Deletable} operations (e.g. Boolean, Future<Boolean>, resource type etc).
 * @param <H>   The type of {@link io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.Watch}.
 * @param <W>   The type of {@link io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.Watcher}.
