#### Dependency Upgrade
* Fix #5695: Upgrade Fabric8 Kubernetes Model to Kubernetes v1.30.0

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes
* Fix #5947: CRD generation using the v1beta1 version is deprecated. Please use only v1 instead.
* Fix #5960: The KubernetesSerializer will now by default serialize time related types to strings - rather than object, integer, number, or arrays of integer / number. If you are using these types in a custom object and were not including JsonFormat annotations to adjust the serialization they were likely being serialized in a non-standard way that would not be usable other Kubernetes clients, nor match the generated custom resource definition if one was being produced. Please open an issue if you need the previous behavior for whatever reason - there is a workaround by creating a customized KubernetesSerializer.
* `storagemigration.k8s.io/v1alpha1` `StorageVersionMigration` introduced in Kubernetes 1.30.0 is added to [kubernetes-model-storageclass](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/tree/main/kubernetes-model-generator/kubernetes-model-storageclass) module. A dedicated module hasn't been created for this new ApiGroup.
* Fix #6006: Service Catalog extension is deprecated following its deprecation in Kubernetes.

#### New Features
* Fix #5133: Support for using TokenRequest for existing ServiceAccount

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes
* Fix #2718: KubernetesResourceUtil.isResourceReady was deprecated.  Use `client.resource(item).isReady()` or `Readiness.getInstance().isReady(item)` instead.

In order to be consistent all built-in resources will omit empty collections by default.  This is a breaking change if you are relying on an empty collection in a json merge or a strategic merge where the list has a patchStrategy of atomic.  In these circumstances the empty collection will no longer be serialized.  You may instead use a json patch, server side apply instead, or modify the serialized form of the patch.
* Fix #5279: (java-generator) Add native support for `date-time` fields, they are now mapped to native `java.time.ZonedDateTime`

* Fix #4891: address vertx not completely reading exec streams
* Fix #4899: BuildConfigs.instantiateBinary().fromFile() does not time out
* Fix #4908: using the response headers in the vertx response
* Fix #4910: addressing inconsistent behavior with pod exec operations
* Fix #4923: addressing inconsistent behavior with pod exec operations
* Fix #4928: allows non-okhttp clients to handle invalid status
* Fix #4931: using coarse grain locking for all mock server operations

#### Dependency Upgrade
* Fix #4655: Upgrade Fabric8 Kubernetes Model to Kubernetes v1.26.0
* Fix #4804: Update Kubernetes Model GatewayApi to v0.6.0
* Fix #4804: Update CertManager Model to v1.11.0

#### New Features
* Fix #4758: added support for pod ephemeral container operations
* Fix #4929: added support for kustomize api v1beta1

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes
* Fix #4708: The signature of the Interceptor methods changed to pass the full HttpRequest, rather than just the headers, and explicitly pass request tags - in particular the RequestConfig.  To simplify authentication concerns the following fields have been removed from RequestConfig: username, password, oauthToken, and oauthTokenProvider.  Not all HttpClient implementation support setting the connectionTimeout at a request level, thus it was removed from the RequestConfig as well.
* Fix #4659: The SupportTestingClient interface has been deprecated.  Please use one of the supports methods or getApiGroup to determine what is available on the api server.
* Fix #4802: to ease developer burden, and potentially bad behavior with the vertx client, the callbacks for Watcher and ResourceEventHandler will no longer be made by an HttpClient thread, but rather from the thread pool associated with the KubernetesClient.  Please ensure that if you are customizing the Executor supplied to the client that it has sufficient threads to handle these callbacks.
* Fix #4825: removed or deprecated/moved methods that are unrelated to the rolling timeout from ImageEditReplacePatchable.  Deprecated rollout methods for timeout and edit - future versions will not support
* Fix #4826: removed RequestConfig upload connection and rolling timeouts.  Both were no longer used with no plans to re-introduce their usage.
* Fix #4861: several breaking changes related to resourceVersion handling and the replace operation:
  - `replace` is deprecated, you should use `update` instead. If you set the resourceVersion to null it will not be optimistically locked.
  - `createOrReplace` is deprecated, you should use server side apply instead.
  - `edit` uses now optimistic locking by default. To disable locking you should change your methods to follow this pattern: `.edit(pod -> new PodBuilder(pod).editMetadata().withResourceVersion(null)//...`
  - JSON patch methods using an item for the diff generation such as edit or patch will no longer omit the resourceVersion in the patch.  If you want the patch to be unlocked, then set the resourceVersion to null on the item to be patched.
  - internal logic to mimic an apply that modify an item prior to a JSON patch is deprecated - you should instead build the item to be patched off of base version, such as with the edit method.

#### _**Note**_: Deprecations
* Fix #4875: Deprecated all the java-generator options identified for deletion in a following release

### 6.4.1 (2023-01-31)

#### Bugs
* Fix #4795: don't print warning message when service account token property is unset
* Fix #4809: VertxHttpClientBuilder is public
* Fix #4811: HttpClient.Factory instances can be prioritized

### 6.4.0 (2023-01-19)

#### Bugs
* Fix #4249: prevent the over-logging of errors after the websocket has been closed
* Fix #4563: fallback to current class-loader when looking for HttpClient implementations
* Fix #4650: allowing for comments at the end of certificate files
* Fix #4668: use acme.cert-manager.io ApiGroup for Orders and Challenges
* Fix #4726: prevent the over-logging of errors after the websocket has been closed
* Fix #4729: ensuring `CompletableFuture` cancel will close / cancel the underlying resource
* Fix #4735: StandardHttpClient sends Expect 100-continue header value

#### Improvements
* Fix #4622: Java Generator Maven Plugin can use CRDs from remote URLs
* Fix #4633: provided inline access to all RunConfig builder methods via run().withNewRunConfig()
* Fix #4637: all pod operations that require a ready / succeeded pod may use withReadyWaitTimeout, which supersedes withLogWaitTimeout.
* Fix #4654: Fix GatewayClass to not implement Namespaced interface
* Fix #4670: the initial informer listing will use a resourceVersion of 0 to utilize the watch cache if possible.  This means that the initial cache state when the informer is returned, or the start future is completed, may not be as fresh as the previous behavior which forced the latest version.  It will of course become more consistent as the watch will already have been established.
* Fix #4694: (java-generator) Option to override the package name of the generated code.
* Fix #4698: changes were made to improve authentication logic.  If a username and password are specified and you are using a base KuberentesClient, then that will always be used as a basic auth header value.  If a username and password are specified and you are using an OpenShiftClient, then a token will still be used if present, but upon an auth failure the username and password will be used to obtain a fresh token.  If a new token is obtained it will be saved in the kubeconfig if one were used to create the Config.
* Fix #4720: interceptors close any response body if the response is not a 2xx response.
* Fix #4734: @KubernetesTest annotation can be used in base test classes
* Fix #4734: @KubernetesTest creates an ephemeral Namespace optionally (can opt-out)

#### New Features
* Fix #2764: Vert.x HttpClient implementation

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes
* Fix #3972: deprecated Parameterizable and methods on Serialization accepting parameters - that was only needed as a workaround for non-string parameters.  You should instead include those parameter values in the map passed to processLocally.
* Fix #3972: OpenShiftClient.load will no longer implicitly process templates.  Use OpenShiftClient.templates().load instead.
* Fix #3972: WARNING: future client versions will not provide the static yaml and json ObjectMappers on Serialization.
* Fix #4574: fromServer has been deprecated - it no longer needs to be called.  All get() operations will fetch the resource(s) from the api server.  If you need the context item that was passed in from a resource, load, or resourceList methods, use the item or items method.
* Fix #4633: client.run().withRunConfig was deprecated.  Use withNewRunConfig instead.
* Fix #4663: Config.maxConcurrentRequests and Config.maxConcurrentRequestsPerHost will no longer be used.  Instead they will default to unlimited for all clients.  Due to the ability of the fabric8 client to start long running requests (either websocket or regular http) and how this is treated by the underlying clients you can easily exhaust these values and enter a state where the client is unresponsive without any additional information on what is occurring.
* Fix #4769: java-generator Fix encoding of empty strings as valid enums

### 6.3.1 (2022-12-15)

#### Bugs
* Fix #4666: fixed okhttp calls not explicitly closing
* Fix #4673: fixes a regression in sharing the OpenShiftOAuthInterceptor token
* Fix #4677: java-generator Fix default encoding of enums

### 6.3.0 (2022-12-12)

* Fix #4590: only using a builder if there are visitors
* Fix #4540: treating GenericKubernetesResource and RawExtension as buildable
* Fix #4547: preventing timing issues with leader election cancel
* Fix #4569: fixing jdk httpclient regression with 0 timeouts
* Fix #4581: "float" types in spec for CRD generator are supported
* Fix #4610: inconsistent additionalPrinterColumns jsonPath
* Fix #4641: fixed regression with missing initial watch event

#### Improvements
* Fix #4014: added support for OpenShift Build log version.
* Fix #4201: Removed sendAsync from the individual http client implementations
* Fix #4355: for exec, attach, upload, and copy operations the container id/name will be validated or chosen prior to the remote call.  You may also use the kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container annotation to specify the default container.
* Fix #4363: exposed ResourceCompare.metadataChanged
* Fix #4530: generalizing the Serialization logic to allow for primitive values and clarifying the type expectations.

#### New Features
* Fix #4136: added support for fieldValidation as a dsl method for POST/PUT/PATCH operations
* Fix #3896: added dsl support for server side apply
* Fix #4582: updated client.secrets createOrReplace document
* Fix #4516: added support for blocking delete operations using the withTimeout methods: op.withTimeout(1, TimeUnit.MINUTE).delete() - will wait for up to 1 minute for the resources to be fully deleted. This makes for a more concise replacement of the deletingExisting method.

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes
* Fix #3923: removed KubernetesResourceMappingProvider - a META-INF/services/io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.KubernetesResource list of resources is used instead.
* Fix #4515: files located at the root of jars named model.properties, e.g. core.properties, have been removed
* Fix #4579: the implicit registration of resource and list types that happens when using the resource(class) methods has been removed. This makes the behavior of the client more predictable as that was an undocumented side-effect.  If you expect to see instances of a custom type from an untyped api call - typically KubernetesClient.load, KubernetesClient.resourceList, KubernetesClient.resource(InputStream|String), then you must either create a META-INF/services/io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.KubernetesResource file (see above #3923), or make calls to KubernetesDeserializer.registerCustomKind - however since KubernetesDeserializer is an internal class that mechanism is not preferred.
* Fix #4597: remove the deprecated support for `javax.validation.constraints.NotNull` in the `crd-generator`, to mark a property as `required` it needs to be annotated with `io.fabric8.generator.annotation.Required`
* Fix #4363: deprecated existing ResourceCompare methods such as compareKubernetesResource as they are not for general use

### 6.2.0 (2022-10-20)

#### Bugs
* Fix #3733: The authentication command from the .kube/config won't be discarded if no arguments are specified

* Fix #4369: Informers will retry with a backoff on list/watch failure as they did in 5.12 and prior.
* Fix #4350: SchemaSwap annotation is now repeatable and is applied multiple times if classes are used more than once in the class hierarchy.
* Fix #3733: The authentication command from the .kube/config won't be discarded if no arguments are specified
* Fix #4441: corrected patch base handling for the patch methods available from a Resource - resource(item).patch() will be evaluated as resource(latest).patch(item). Also undeprecated patch(item), which is consistent with leaving patch(context, item) undeprecated as well. For consistency with the other operations (such as edit), patch(item) will use the context item as the base when available, or the server side item when not. This means that patch(item) is only the same as resource(item).patch() when the patch(item) is called when the context item is missing or is the same as the latest.
* Fix #4442: TokenRefreshInterceptor doesn't overwrite existing OAuth token with empty string
* Fix #4350: SchemaSwap annotation is now repeatable and is applied multiple times if classes are used more than once in the class hierarchy.
* Fix #4459: Fixed OSGi startup exceptions while using KubernetesClient/OpenShiftClient

#### Improvements
* Fix #4471: Adding KubernetesClientBuilder.withHttpClientBuilderConsumer to further customize the HttpClient for any implementation.
* Fix #4348: Introduce specific annotations for the generators
* Fix #4441: refactoring `TokenRefreshInterceptor`
* Fix #4365: The Watch retry logic will handle more cases, as well as perform an exceptional close for events that are not properly handled. Informers can directly provide those exceptional outcomes via the SharedIndexInformer.stopped CompletableFuture.
* Fix #4396: Provide more error context when @Group/@Version annotations are missing
* Fix #4384: The Java generator now supports the generation of specific annotations (min, max, pattern, etc.), as defined by #4348
* Fix #4408: Allowing informers started via the start() method to have configurable exception / retry handling.
* Fix #3864: Change ManagedOpenShiftClient OSGi ConfigurationPolicy to REQUIRE

* Fix #4351: add `javax.annotation.processing.Generated` to classes generated with the `java-generator`

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes in the API
* Fix #4350: SchemaSwap's fieldName parameter now expects a field name only, not a method or a constructor.
* Module `io.fabric8:tekton-model-triggers` which contained Tekton triggers v1alpha1 model has been removed. We have introduced separate modules `io.fabric8:tekton-model-v1alpha1` and `io.fabric8:tekton-model-v1beta1` for Tekton triggers v1alpha1 and v1beta1 apigroups respectively. Users who are using `io.fabric8:tekton-client` dependency directly should be unaffected by this change.
* Fix #3864: Now it's compulsory to provide `etc/io.fabric8.openshift.client.cfg` file in order to load ManagedOpenShiftClient in OSGi environment.
* Fix #3924: Extension Mock modules have been removed
* Fix #4384: javax.validation.* annotations are no longer added by the Java generator.
* Fix #3906: removed BaseKubernetesList, use KubernetesList instead
* Fix #4408: deprecated SharedInformerFactory.addSharedInformerEventListener, instead use the SharedIndexInformer.stopped method.  Also the signature of SharedIndexInformer.start was changed to a CompletionStage rather than a CompletableFuture.

  There is also client.resourceList(...).resources() and client.configMaps().resources() - that will provide a Resource stream.
  This allows you to implement composite operations easily with lambda: client.secrets().resources().forEach(r -> r.delete());
* Fix #3472 #3587: Allowing for customization of the Informer store/cache key function and how state is stored. See BasicItemStore and ReducedStateItemStore and the SharedIndexInformer.itemStore function
* Fix #3855: Created a new kubernetes-httpclient-jdk module with an HttpClient implementation based on the Java HttpClient
* Fix #3922: added Client.supports and Client.hasApiGroup methods

  - Classes extending the `CustomResource` class can now be used as the basis for CRD generation
  - Several annotations are available to override the default behavior if it doesn't fit your needs
  - Validation schema is automatically derived from your class' spec implementation (or from the CR
    class, if no spec is present)
  - CRDs are automatically generated at compile-time if you include the `io.fabric8:crd-generator`
    dependency to your project (with the suggested `compile` scope)
  - CRDs are generated for both `v1beta1` and `v1` versions of the specification at this point
  - One CRD manifest is generated per CRD using the CRD name (e.g. `mycrplural.group.example.com`)
    suffixed with the specification version, e.g. `mycrplural.group.example.com-v1.yml`
  - The CRD files are generated in the `target/META-INF/fabric8` directory of your project

#### _**Note**_: Breaking changes in the API
##### DSL Changes:
- `client.settings()` DSL has been removed since PodPreset v1alpha1 API is no longer present in Kubernetes 1.20.x

- `client.events()` has been removed. Use `client.v1().events()` instead
- `client.customResource(...)` method is removed. Use `client.customResources(...)` with CustomResource configuration in annotations inside POJOs

##### Model Changes:

* Fix #2642: Update kubernetes-examples to use apps/v1 Deployment rather than extensions/v1beta1
* Fix #2666: Align SharedIndexInformer API with Custom Resource Improvements

#### New Features
* Fix #2611: Support for Custom Resource and Custom Resource Definitions has been improved
  - New annotations have been introduced for users to specify group, version, singular and plural
    properties for `CustomResource` instances
  - `CustomResource` instances must now be annotated with `@Version` and `@Group` so that the
    associated information can be automatically computed
  - `HasMetadata` provides default implementations for `getApiVersion` and `getKind` based on the
    presence (or not) of annotations on the target class
  - Static methods have been introduced on `HasMetadata` and `CustomResource` to encapsulate the
    logic used to resolve `Kind`, `ApiVersion`, `Group`, `Version`, `Plural`, `Singular` and `CRD Name`
    properties
  - New `v1CRDFromCustomResourceType` and `v1beta1CRDFromCustomResourceType` methods have been
    introduced on `CustomResourceDefinitionContext` to initialize a `CustomResourceDefinitionBuilder`
    with the information provided by a specific `CustomResource` implementation, making it much
    easier to create CRDs if you already have defined your custom resource type
  - `CustomResource` is now parameterized by the spec and status types that it uses which further
    removes boiler plate
* Rename `@ApiVersion` and `@ApiGroup` to simply `@Version` and `@Group`, respectively. This was done
  to unify annotations and also remove potential confusion between values provided to `@ApiVersion`
  and what is returned by `HasMetadata#getApiVersion`

- Some classes have been renamed:
   - `io.fabric8.tekton.pipeline.v1beta1.WorkspacePipelineDeclaration` is now `io.fabric8.tekton.pipeline.v1beta1.PipelineWorkspaceDeclaration`
- Breaking changes in `KubernetesClient` `customResource()` typed API:
  - We've introduced a major breaking change in customResource(...) typed API. We have introduced a new interface `io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.Namespaced` which needs to
    be added to your Custom Types using typed API. For example, for a custom resource named `Animals` which is a [Namespaced](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) resource; It should be declared like this:
    ```
    public class Animals extends CustomResource implements Namespaced { ... }
    ```
    You can also checkout an example in our test suite for this: [PodSet.java](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/kubernetes-tests/src/test/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/mock/crd/PodSet.java#L22)
