For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to.

          "description": "Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n## Distinct Listeners\n\nEach Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_ apply in that case).\n\nPractically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\nSome combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects they support:\n\nHTTPRoute\n\n1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\nTLSRoute\n\n1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n\"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n**The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct Listener**.\n\nWhen multiple Listeners share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other Listener fields.\n\nWhen multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different values for other fields.\n\nThe set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol. The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the Gateway API spec.\n\nThe set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_ values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n* **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\nOne **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an implementation:\n\n* Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n  Listeners, and\n* sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n  Protocol.\n\nIn this case all the Listeners that share a port with the TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\nIf an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be accepted.\n\nNote that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\nWhen the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\nExact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\nAdditionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\nThe precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\nThe wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\nIf a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\" condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\nThe words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the purpose of this documentation.\n\nImplementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners.\n\nSpecifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to the following rules:\n\n* The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n  ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n* At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n  contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\nThe implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n## General Listener behavior\n\nNote that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\nThis concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\nImplementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated conformance tests.\n\n## Compatible Listeners\n\nA Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n1. They are distinct. 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n   requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n   addresses.\n\nCompatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation may not be compatible for another.\n\nFor example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\nImplementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\nIn a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\nSupport: Core",

For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules.

Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\nIn the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\nPolicies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying implementations.\n\nFor example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway. In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\nNote that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\nThis struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map, with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.",

Note that the referenced parent resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n\n\u003cgateway:experimental:description\u003e ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service.\n\nParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route. \u003c/gateway:experimental:description\u003e\n\n\u003cgateway:standard:validation:XValidation:message=\"sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes 2 or more references to the same parent\",rule=\"self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__) || p1.__namespace__ == '') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__ == '')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?

ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_.

In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.

For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the Route.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile) * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent resources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n* They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n  entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n  combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n  same object must also set `sectionName`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n  object must also set `port`.\n* If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n  referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\nIt is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be merged.\n\nNote that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific rules.
