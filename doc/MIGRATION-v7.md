## Bouncy Castle is no longer needed <a href="#bouncy-castle" id="bouncy-castle"/>

The Bouncy Castle library is no longer needed as a dependency.
In previous versions, this was an optional dependency needed for Elliptic Curve (EC) Keys.
The Kubernetes client now uses the default Java security provider which should be enough to handle all scenarios.
