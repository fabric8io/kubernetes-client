# Frequently Asked Questions:

### How do I use KubernetesClient with IPv6 Kubernetes Clusters?
We're aware of this [issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/2632) in Fabric8 Kubernetes Client. Unfortunately, this is caused by the OkHttp transitive dependency. You can check suggested workaround here:

### What artifact(s) should my project depend on?
Fabric8 version 6 introduces more options with regards to dependencies.

1. Have compile dependencies on kubenetes-client or openshift-client - this is no different than what was done with version 5 and before.  If you have done custom development involving effectively internal classes, you'll need to still use this option.

2. Have compile dependencies on kubenetes-client-api or openshift-client-api, and a runtime dependency on kubenetes-client or openshift-client.  This option will provide your application with a cleaner compile time classpath.

Further more you will also have choices in the HttpClient that is utilized.  

By default kubenetes-client has a runtime dependency on OkHttp (kubernetes-httpclient-okhttp).  If you need to directly manipulate OkHttp, you add a compile dependency to kubernetes-httpclient-okhttp.  

If you wish to use another HttpClient implementation typically you will exclude kubernetes-httpclient-okhttp and include the other runtime dependency instead.
